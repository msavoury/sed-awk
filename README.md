# sed #

The ```-e``` option is only necessary when specifying more than one instruction via the command line

The ** -r ** option allows use of extended regular expressions (|, ? , +, etc..)

It's also possible to separate instructions with the use of a semicolon
```sed 's/ MA/Mass'; s/PA/Penn'```

The ```-n``` option is used to suppress the output 

## Ranges ##
With **grep** - escape the brackets: ```grep  '10\{1,3\}1' one_zero.txt ``` 

With **egrep** - escaping is not needed: ```egrep  '10{1,3}1' one_zero.txt ```

## Line Addressing ##
Sed commands can specify zero, one or two addresses. An address can be a regex, a line number, or a line addressing symbol (e.g. ^ and $)

- No address: command applied to each line
- One address: command applied to any line that matches address
- 2 comma separated addresses: command applied to all matching lines within range (inclusive)
- If an address is followed by an exclamation point (!) command applied to all non-matching lines

Example of 2 address command
```
 sed -n '/3./,/7./s/[0-9]*/1/p' 1_to_100.txt 
```
If an address is followed by a (!) symbol, then the command will apply to all the lines that do **not** match the address

# awk #
The ```-F``` option is used to specify a different field separator

Awk variables are initialized to an empty string
