# sed-awk #

Use the **-f** option to specify a file 
```sed -f scriptfile inputfile```

## Character classes: ##

| Character Class  | Purpose |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|[:alnum:]  | Printable chars |
|[:alnum:]| Printable chars (includes whitespace)|
|[:alpha:]| Alphabetic chars|
|[:blank:]| Space and tab chars|
|[:cntrl:]| Control chars|
|[:digit:]| Numeric chars|
|[:graph:]| Printable and visible (non-space) chars|
|[:lower:]| Lowercase chars|
|[:print:]| Printable chars|
|[:punct:]| Punctuation chars|
|[:space:]| Whitespace chars|
|[:upper:]| Uppercase chars|
|[:xdigit:]| hexadecimal chars|

**Example usage:** ``` sed 's/[[:lower:]]/X/' the_times.txt ```

# sed #
## Options##

**-e** - Use to specify multiple instructions on the command line

```sed -e 's/line/loan/' -e 's/word/wizard/' data/the_times.txt```

**-r** - allows use of extended regular expressions (|, ? , +, etc..)

**;** - separate instructions on command line ```sed 's/ MA/Mass; s/PA/Penn'```

**-n** - use to suppress output 

## Ranges ##
With **grep** - escape the brackets: ```grep  '10\{1,3\}1' one_zero.txt ``` 

With **egrep** - escaping is not needed: ```egrep  '10{1,3}1' one_zero.txt ```

## Line Addressing ##
Sed commands can specify zero, one or two addresses. An address can be a regex, a line number, or a line addressing symbol (e.g. ^ and $)

- No address: command applied to each line
- One address: command applied to any line that matches address
- 2 comma separated addresses: command applied to all matching lines within range (inclusive)
- If an address is followed by an exclamation point (!) command applied to all non-matching lines

Example: Match (and print) the 3rd line
```
sed -n '3 p' data/the_times.txt
```

Example of a 2-address command
```
 sed -n '/3./,/7./s/[0-9]*/1/p' 1_to_100.txt 
```
If an address is followed by a (!) symbol, then the command will apply to all the lines that do **not** match the address

## Commands ##

### Substitution (s) ###
Syntax: 
``` [address]s/<pattern>/<replacement>/<flags> ```

Where &lt;flags&gt; can be:
- **n** - A number (up to 512) indicating replacement occur on nth pattern
- **g** - Make changes globally 
- **p** - Print contents of pattern space 
- **w (file)** - Write contents of pattern space to file 

#### Replacement characters ####
- **&** is used for the match made
- **\n** is for the nth match (based on pairs of parens in the pattern)

### Delete (d) ###
Takes an address and deletes pattern space if line matches address

Example: delete all lines that start with capital 'T'
```
sed '/^T/d' data/the_times.txt
```

### Append (a) / Change (c) / Insert (i) ###
- Each of these commands requires a backslash following it to escape the first end-of-line. Text must begin on the next line

Example: Prepend each line with an asterisk
```
sed '/^/i\
*' data/the_times.txt

```

### List (l) ###
Use to print non-printing characters as ASCII codes
- Tip: Use -n to suppress normal output
```
sed -n l data/*
```

### Transform (y) ###
Use to transform characters of one set to characters of a second set

- Tip: The length of both sets must be equal
Example: Change each letter 'a' to a '1' and each 'b' to a '2'
```
sed 'y/ab/12/' data/the_times.txt
```

### Next (n) ###
Reads the content of the pattern space then reads next line of input w/o returning to the top of the script
- Tip: This command is normally used in combination with other commands in a script

### Print (p) and Line Number (=)
The p command will print the matched line
- Tip: Use the p command when suppressing output to print matched lines 

Example: Print the first line twice (once as normal output, once for matching first line)
```
sed '1 p' data/the_times.txt
```
The (=) command prints the line number of the matched line

Example: Print line numbers of lines containing the word 'match'
```
sed '/match/=' data/the_times.txt
```

## Grouping Commands ##
Use curly brackets to group commands for a matched line
```
/This/{
    s/^Th/h/
    =   
    y/o/e/
}
```

## Misc ##



# awk #
The ```-F``` option is used to specify a different field separator

Awk variables are initialized to an empty string
